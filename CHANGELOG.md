- ProgressModal dismisses job store state after successful `goto()` navigation (handles rejection too)
- `reopenModal()` guards against null `jobId` to prevent inconsistent store state
- `Math.max(0, ...)` for remaining files count when `completed + failed > total_files` (retry scenarios)

### Fixed

- Windows path separator mismatches in organizer plan tests and batch preview tests (hardcoded `/` vs `\` from `filepath.Join`)- Windows file handle locks preventing `t.TempDir()` cleanup — added `defer CloseLogger()` and `defer db.Close()` in test helpers- Windows `filepath.IsAbs` returning false for `\dest\...` paths (no drive letter) in multipart test- Windows tilde expansion failure in `validateNFOPath` — `filepath.Join("~", ...)` produces `~\...` which doesn't match the `~/` prefix check- Windows double-slash in database error messages — normalized with `strings.ReplaceAll("//", "/")` after `filepath.ToSlash`- Windows `WillMove` incorrectly `true` when source/target paths differ only in separator style (production bug in `organizer.go`, `strategy_organize.go`, `strategy_inplace.go`, `strategy_inplace_norenamefolder.go`)- Windows `isDescendant()` failing to detect descendant paths due to separator mismatch- Windows `cleanupEmptyDir` walking past drive root — added `filepath.VolumeName` root detection- Windows concurrent config writer test timing out due to different file locking semantics- Windows `fsPath()` drive-letter check order — check before `filepath.ToSlash()` to avoid dead code- Windows afero MemMapFs path lookup failures in `ReadNFOSnapshot` — use `fsPath()` to strip drive letter and normalize separators- Windows LogDir output using backslash separators — apply `filepath.ToSlash` in `overrides.go`

### Changed

- Javstash scraper `module.go` proxy declaration changed from value type `config.ProxyConfig` to pointer type `*config.ProxyConfig`, matching the pattern used by all other 13 scrapers- `AggregatorOptions` and `Aggregator` struct fields changed from concrete `*database.GenreReplacementRepository`/`*database.ActressAliasRepository` to interface types `database.GenreReplacementRepositoryInterface`/`database.ActressAliasRepositoryInterface`- `processUpdateJob` and `processUpdateMode` now accept `*UpdateOptions` parameter for configurable update behavior- `processOrganizeJob` now accepts `skipNFO` and `skipDownload` parameters- `updateBatchJob` handler now parses optional `UpdateRequest` body (backward compatible with empty body), validates job existence/status before body parsing, and returns 400 for malformed JSON- `persistToDatabase` uses `Upsert` instead of `FindByID` + `Create`/`Update`, eliminating persistence race condition- All 14 scraper module.go files updated to import `models.ScraperOption`/`models.ScraperChoice` instead of `contracts.ScraperOption`/`contracts.ScraperChoice`- Downloader HTTP client creation deferred until actually needed — `skip_download=true` no longer triggers downloader setup, preventing proxy/registry errors on NFO-only updates- `preserve_nfo` now uses `PreserveExisting` merge strategy (not `PreferNFO`) to prevent blanking fields when existing NFO is incomplete- `preserve_nfo` takes final precedence after preset resolution, preventing silent override- DisplayTitle templating runs for ALL update paths (including `force_overwrite`), not just the NFO merge block- Preview `$effect` reactive to skip toggles via `void` references; retry path persists last update options and skip flags- Force Overwrite and Preserve NFO made mutually exclusive in UI via reactive `$effects`- Test databases switched from in-memory shared-cache SQLite to temp file-based SQLite with WAL mode, eliminating `database table is locked` flaky test failures under concurrency- Cross-platform path utility (`path.ts`) with `splitPath`, `buildPathUp`, `buildBreadcrumbPath`, `isRootPath` functions for Windows/Unix path handling- FileBrowser breadcrumb navigation, "go up" button, and path construction now use cross-platform path utility instead of Unix-only logic- OperationRow truncated paths now show 40/60 head-tail split with click-to-expand/collapse- 54 files changed, ~1,192 lines added, ~468 lines removed

### Fixed

- Unauthenticated users cannot create admin accounts via `/auth/setup` without bootstrap secret or local access- Authenticated API endpoints reject excessive requests from a single IP with 429 response- Invalid `sort_by` query parameters rejected with 400 instead of being passed to the database- Session cookies have Secure flag set when request arrives via HTTPS reverse proxy- HTTP response bodies fully drained before close on all error paths — no leaked connections- Job cleanup goroutine stops cleanly when application shuts down- Concurrent access to BatchJob fields passes race detector with no warnings- Download errors for covers, posters, and trailers visible in logs and API responses- Cache miss errors distinguishable from actual database failures in code- Job queue persistence failures visible in job status- Review page explicitly requests full batch data (`include_data=true`) to prevent blank editor- Slim polling by default for `BackgroundJobIndicator` and `ProgressModal` — avoids unnecessary payload overhead- Genre replacement POST/DELETE routes under rate-limited `writeProtected` group- `GetStatusSlim` deep-copies `FieldSources` and `ActressSources` maps to prevent shared mutable state- Preview effect gated during organize polling to avoid redundant `/preview` API calls

### Removed

- `normalizeJSONLDImageURL` dead code from `internal/scraper/dmm/jsonld.go`- Ineffective first loop from `extractDescriptionNewSite` in `internal/scraper/dmm/video_dmm.go`

### Security

## [v0.2.6-alpha] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- SSRF protection package (`internal/ssrf`) with `NewSSRFSafeClient()`, `WrapTransportWithSSRFCheck()`, and `CheckRedirect()` validation blocking private/loopback/link-local IPs- Typed scraper error model (`models.ScraperError`) with categorized error kinds (network, parsing, not-found, rate-limit, auth, timeout, context-cancelled)- Config redaction utility (`internal/config/redact.go`) for safe logging of sensitive fields (API keys, passwords, tokens)- Panic recovery middleware for batch processing with structured error reporting- Job queue improvements: context-aware cancellation, improved state transitions, structured error aggregation- Batch query support for movie repository (`FindMoviesByIDs`, `FindMoviesByContentIDs`) reducing N+1 database queries- Translation service typed errors with retry classification- Panic recovery tests for batch execute pipeline

### Changed

- Context propagation threaded through all 14 scrapers: `.SetContext(ctx)` on every resty request in ctx-aware methods- Context threaded through full DMM actress thumbnail chain: `parseHTML` → `extractActresses` → `extractActressFromLink` → `tryActressThumbURLs` → `extractRomajiVariantsFromActressPageCtx`- Context threaded through JavDB `Search` retry and `ScrapeURL` paths via `fetchPageDirectCtx`- Context threaded through DMM `FetchWithBrowser` as chromedp parent context- Context threaded through `DownloadMediaFiles` → `DownloadAll` chain- Aggregator simplified with typed scraper errors replacing ad-hoc error classification- Worker pool and scraper task pipeline refactored for structured error handling- Downloader retry logic improved with per-error-kind backoff strategies- Temp API handlers now use `ssrf.NewSSRFSafeClient()` instead of raw `http.Client`- Proxy test client uses `resty.NoRedirectPolicy()` to prevent open-redirect SSRF- Removed unused context-free wrapper functions (`fetchPageDirect`, `extractRomajiVariantsFromActressPage`, etc.)- 135 files changed, ~2,659 lines added, ~1,265 lines removed

### Fixed

- SSRF redirect bypass: proxy test and temp API handlers now validate redirect destinations against internal IPs- Scraper context cancellation gaps: all scraper HTTP requests now respect caller context for proper timeout/cancel propagation- DMM actress thumbnail fallback now cancellable (previously used `context.Background()` for romaji lookup and HEAD probes)- JavDB ScrapeURL retry path now respects caller context instead of spawning untracked requests- Batch organize goroutine immediately cancelled due to deriving context from `c.Request.Context()` instead of `context.Background()`

### Security

- SSRF hardening: `NewSSRFSafeClient()` blocks connections to loopback, private, and link-local IP ranges (prevents cloud metadata credential exfiltration via `169.254.169.254` and internal service access)- SSRF redirect validation: `CheckRedirect()` blocks HTTP redirects to internal IP addresses- Config redaction prevents API keys and tokens from leaking into logs
